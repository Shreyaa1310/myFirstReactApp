      "Located on the French Riviera, Nice offers beautiful beaches, a charming old town, and the famous Promenade des Anglais. It’s the perfect mix of city life and coastal relaxation.Nice is a major commercial and administrative centre in the east of the Provence–Alpes–Côte d'Azur region, its influence extending well beyond the boundary of the Alpes-Maritimes département. Numerous small and medium-sized factories are located at Nice, particularly in the Var Plain to the west.The Paillon River, now partly built over, separates the new town to the west from the old town, the harbour, and the commercial district to the east. The old town, with narrow winding streets, stands at the western base of a granite hill known as Le Château, although the castle that used to crown it was destroyed in 1706. The harbour, begun in 1750 and extended after 1870, is now used primarily by ferry services to Corsica and by sailing craft.There is also a regular passenger service to Corsica.",

      "A region in southeastern France known for its stunning lavender fields, rolling vineyards, and picturesque villages. A must-visit for nature lovers and wine enthusiasts.Provence, historical and cultural region encompassing the southeastern French départements of Bouches-du-Rhône, Vaucluse, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, and Var. It is roughly coextensive with the former province of Provence and with the present-day region of Provence-Alpes-Cote d’Azur.With the establishment of Greek colonies (among them Massilia [modern Marseille]) in the area by the beginning of the 6th century bce, Provence was first oriented toward the civilization of the Mediterranean. In 125 bce the Massiliots appealed to the Romans for help against a coalition of neighbouring Celts and Ligurians.The Romans defeated the coalition but remained in occupation of the region. Thus, by the end of the 2nd century bce, Provence formed part of Gallia Transalpina, the first Roman provincia beyond the Alps.",

      "A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lyon is famous for its historical architecture, vibrant culinary scene, and cultural festivals. It’s the gastronomic capital of France.Lyon, capital of both the Rhône département and the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes région, east-central France, set on a hilly site at the confluence of the Rhône and Saône rivers. It is the third largest city in France, after Paris and Marseille.A Roman military colony called Lugdunum was founded there in 43 bce, and it subsequently became the capital of the Gauls. Lyon reached its peak of classical development in the 2nd century ce, during which time Christianity was introduced. In 177 the Christian community was persecuted by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, and in 197 Lucius Septimius Severus decimated Lyon.In 1032 Lyon was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire, but the real power lay with the city’s archbishops, whose influence caused important ecumenical councils to be held there in 1245 and again in 1274.",

      "A breathtaking island commune in Normandy, crowned by a medieval abbey. Mont Saint-Michel is surrounded by tidal waters, creating an awe-inspiring view.Perched on a rocky islet in the midst of vast sandbanks exposed to powerful tides, at the limit between Normandy and Brittany, stands “Wonder of the West”, a Gothic-style Benedictine abbey dedicated to the Archangel St Michel, and the village that grew up in the shadow of its walls.The commune's position—on an island just a few hundred metres (yards) from land—made it accessible at low tide to the many pilgrims to its abbey, and defensible as the incoming tide stranded, drove off, or drowned would-be assailants. The island remained unconquered during the Hundred Years' War. A small garrison fended off a full attack by the English in 1433.In 2023, President Macron marked 1,000 years of the abbey, and the success of the hydraulic dam project and the elevated pedestrian bridge in restoring water flow in the bay, making the mount an island again",
